Given endpoints of non-overlapping intervals, return a piece-wise linear map and a smooth approximation to it that transports the uniform distribution to a piece-wise constant distribution. The application for this is in optimization. See example here.\n\n\n# Getting Started\nAdd (currently) unregistered public Julia package for dependency before installing NMRSpectraSimulator.jl\n\"\"\"\n\nimport Pkg\nPkg.add(path=\"https://github.com/RoyCCWang/IntervalMonoFuncs.jl\")\n\n\n\n# Piece-wise linear function\n##Our definition of the indicator function in this work is\n\n```math\n1_{a,b}\\left(x\\right):=\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if }x\\in\\left[a,b\\right]\\subset\\left[-1,1\\right],\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n```","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"-","title":"-","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"-","title":"-","text":"This page was generated using Literate.jl.","category":"page"}]
